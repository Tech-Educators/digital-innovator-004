# Welcome to your demos DI004!

## What is this?

This GitHub repository is where you will find the demo code from each lesson, organised by:

1. The week we did it.
2. The lesson number of that week.

## How to use it?

Navigate to the `week-xx` folder of the lesson you wish to view.

Then, navigate to the ``xx-lesson-name` folder.

In there, you will see all of the code files from that demo.

I'd **strongly recommend** that you type out all code yourself! This will help your 'muscle memory' and also help you to get a feel for what each piece of code does, **and** it sharpens your "code review" skills!

But, there will be times where my `variable` name or `CSS-class` doesn't match yours, and you'll have to fix that yourself.
